# Returns API
I will probably need some required inputs (Two columns)
- First Name (Left column)
- Last Name (Right Column)
- Order Number (single column)
*Part section should be wrapped in a border of some kind for readability*
- Part they want to return (Left Column)
- Product is any of the following (Dropdown, Right Column):
    - Ordered wrong item
    - Duplicate order of product
    - Wrong part
    - Damaged in shipping
    - Did not fit
    - Changed my mind

**(Add a button here if they have multiple items they would like to return if it's the same order number)**
- Store Credit or Refund selection
- Message (Any details they would like to share with us)

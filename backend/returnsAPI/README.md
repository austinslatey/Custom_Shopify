# Returns API

## Acceptance Criteria
https://trucksandvanstore.returnly.com/ does not work

I need an easy form that completes what happened in this link

and send all the data into NetSuite so that 

people are able to submit their return info & employees are able to view that return data and issue a refund


## MY plan 
Custom Build: If you need something fully bespoke, create a Shopify page with a form (using Liquid/HTML), capture data via webhooks, and post to NetSuite's REST API (docs at https://system.netsuite.com/app/help/helpcenter.nl?fid=chapter_4406046579.html). This requires dev work but avoids app fees.
